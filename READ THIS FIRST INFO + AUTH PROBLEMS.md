# <u>AUTH INFORMATION + STATUS UPDATES</u>
A few scripts from now on will be authed by either donators or by good friends of mine, due to the 'disagreements' between me and <i>some</i> devs + scriptsers + admins.

I no longer wish to support spudgy on the scripting side unless I get gratitude or fair ground.  Call me Yomie if you will.

# Script open beta is now <u>CLOSED.</u> Thank you to all the contributors, current contributors will have lifetime access.
